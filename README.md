# Explaining this Repo
This repo is where I practice leetcode or problems from CodeForces.
If the file starts with a A B C D or E it's a problem from Codeforces with the same difficulty with the competition number its from next to it. If it starts with an L its from Leetcode with the corresponding problem number next to it.
